      journal: "27th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT 2024)",
      year: "2024",
      description: "This paper details a GSM-integrated autonomous cleaning robot that uses an Arduino Uno and various sensors to navigate and clean homes efficiently. Its key feature is a GSM module that enables users to remotely control the robot via SMS commands, allowing for real-time monitoring and control of cleaning operations. The system enhances user convenience and provides a reliable solution for automated household maintenance.",
